            <li>0.5 tbsp palm sugar</li>
            <li>.25 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Nam Jim Jeaw</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 tsp uncooked rice grains, toasted and ground</li>
            <li>2 tbsp lime juice</li>
            <li>1 tbsp fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp tamarind paste</li>
            <li>1 tbsp palm sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp cilantro, chopped</li>
            <li>1-2 tsp chili flakes</li>
            <li>0.5 shallot, cut into wedges</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix together the soy sauce, oyster sauce, oil, palm sugar, and ground black pepper in a bowl until combined. Let the steaks marinate for at least one hour to overnight in the fridge.</li>
            <li>Once marinated, remove the steak from the fridge and let come to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Heat a heavy bottom pan or iron skillet over medium-high heat with 2 tbsp of neutral oil. Fry the marinated steaks until you reach your desired doneness, flipping frequently to avoid overly burning the sugars.</li>
            <li>Set aside, and let rest for at least 10 minutes while you prepare the dipping sauce.</li>
            <li>Heat a dry pan over medium heat. Once hot, add the glutinous rice to the pan and toss/stir continuously until the grains have become golden brown in color.</li>
            <li>Transfer the toasted grains to a mortar and pestle and grind the rice until you achieve a coarse powder.</li>
            <li>Add in the lime juice, fish sauce, tamarind paste, palm sugar, chopped cilantro, Thai chili flakes, and shallots. Mix until well combined and adjust accordingly to tastes.</li>
            <li>Once the steak has adequately rested, slice into strips. Serve the steak alongside the nam jim jeaw and fresh vegetables. Enjoy!</li>
